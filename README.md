#### What is JSON-RPC?

JSON-RPC is a remote procedure call protocol used by microservices, IoT and cryptocurrencies to expose APIs. It is a very simple protocol, defining only a few data types and commands. JSON-RPC allows for notifications (data sent to the server that does not require a response) and for multiple calls to be sent to the server which may be answered out of order.
